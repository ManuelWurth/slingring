# This file contains information only relevant for bootstrapping.
# It will not be part of the universe description created by the bootstrapper.

# A list of files which will be processed while bootstrapping the universe description.
# While processing, all {{ bootstrap.* }} variables will be inserted into the files
# matching the specified filters. The usual glob wildcards are supported. Double
# asterisks (**) can be used for recursive matching. Be careful when adding wildcards
# like '*'. Processing included binary files may take a long time even though there
# are no variables to substitute in them.

# If no filters are provided or this file is missing, no files will be processed while bootstrapping.
