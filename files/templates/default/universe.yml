# The name of the universe. Keep in mind that users will usually
# enter 'slingring name' or 'slingring "name with spaces" to enter
# the universe, so names like VeryLongExampleOfAUniverseName might
# not be very welcome, and underscores or hyphens are usually
# preferable to spaces.
name: << bootstrap.universe_name >>

# The version of this universe description. You can use a completely
# arbitrary string here, since slingring only distinguishes between
# 'same version' and 'other version'. Yet, users might take an interest
# in the version scheme, so use whatever suits them most (e.g. semantic
# versioning or date based versions).
version: << bootstrap.universe_version >>

# The chroot architecture. You can use whatever architecture the desired
# distribution offers, but keep in mind that incompatible architectures
# like ARM on an x86 host might end up unusable. It is usually best to stick
# with amd64 or i386 for debian/ubuntu systems.
arch: amd64

# The suite codename to base the chroot on. The suite must be available
# on the below stated mirror. Debian mirrors will use something like 'jessie'
# (Debian 8) or 'wheezy' (Debian 7). For Ubuntu mirrors, it is advisable to
# use the most current LTS version (at the moment of writing 'xenial').
suite: xenial

# The mirror URL to retrieve the base image from. Choose something that
# will suite most of your users. For an Ubuntu based chroot and a lot
# of German users, you might want to use something like
# http://de.archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu
mirror: http://archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu

# The chroot variant. Debootstrap supports a number of chroot variants
# (see debootstrap(8) man page). The one most common should be minbase.
# This will install the bare essentials. Every universe should only contain
# what it actually needs, since we want to minimize unnecessary duplication.
# It is therefore preferable to use the absolute minimal base image and install
# whatever you need in your ansible playbook.
variant: minbase

# Additionally, you can add a list of desired variables below.
# Slingring will ask the user for these variables when the
# universe is built by their description. You can refer to those
# variables anywhere in your playbooks by their name. A variable named
# ldap_username can be referenced by {{ user_vars.ldap_username }}
# in your Ansible playbooks.
#
# Variables which have the 'secret' flag set to 'yes' will be asked
# without echoing and piped encrypted into Ansible. They will never
# be written unencrypted to the disk unless your Ansible playbook
# does so. A user secret named ldap_password can be referenced by
# {{ user_secrets.ldap_password }}. See the examples below.
#
# variables:
#   - name: ldap_username
#     description: The company LDAP username
#
#   - name: ldap_password
#     description: The company LDAP password
#     secret: yes
#
#   - name: github_username
#     description: The GitHub username
#
#   - name: github_password
#     description: The GitHub password
#     secret: yes
